# Get-in-Touch-Form
Description:
This project is a simple Contact Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes fields for Name, Email, and Message, with real-time client-side validation. JavaScript ensures that all fields are filled and the email follows a valid format using regex. If validation fails, appropriate error messages are shown below each input. Upon successful validation, a success message is displayed, simulating a form submission.
